At the start of a June, I got a DM from a mutual on Twitter whom I've followed and respected their work for years, [Brad Westfall](https://twitter.com/bradwestfall) of [React Training](https://twitter.com/ReactTraining). He was overbooked for client work and asked if I would connect with a client of his and take over some work. That client was [AI Engineer](https://ai.engineer).

In just under 3 weeks, AI Engineer needed to have their web and mobile apps ready for their [World's Fair](https://ai.engineer/worldsfair), a huge, multi-track conference about to take place in San Francisco. We met on Friday, and I was in the codebase, building features and fixing bugs, the following Monday.

Agathist was able to help out in a few key ways:

- Hit the ground running, right away

From day one we were shipping features and making updates. We were able to build out key pages on their web apps: their event schedule and session and workshop detail pages.

- Quickly refactor existing code for reuse

There was a quite a lot of prior art in the codebase from a previous event, AI Summit, that was tightly coupled to the event. But with our skill and expertise in React and frontend, we were able to very quickly decouple the event and the components, allowing us to not only reuse existing components, but make the application more robust in the process.

- Improve UI component APIs

Several of their UI components had difficult to use APIs. With our abundance of design system experience, we were able to quickly update the components and their references throughout the codebase, improving the quality of the code and their ease of use.

- Contribute to their mobile app

It wasn't originally the plan, but Agathist was able to accomplish the web work so well that we were able to tackle the React Native work as well. We were able to deliver a number of key screens and features for the mobile app.

One key feature was the ability for attendees to "favorite" sessions and essentially design their own schedule, given the event was multi-track. With a combo of state management strategies, we were able to make a great UI experience for attendees that was simple to use and maintain as developers as well.

- Help fix performance issues

Originally, the main page of the website was really struggling to perform well. I noticed some API calls that could be parallelized and was able to cut the render time in half. Eventually, we were able to update the page so that it was statically rendered, vastly improving the load time and experience for users.

### Takeaways

If you're a client that needs some short-term expertise, Agathist is more than capable of getting up to speed immediately and contributing day one. You're going to find our expertise is able to lift your existing code to the next level.
