After spending over decade working for a variety of tech companies, from agencies to Silicon Valley startups like Webflow, Fastly, and Virta Health, Kyle wanted to start Agathist with a mission to build good software by good people.

> I first had the idea for Agathist in 2017. You can check the receipts for the domain name! But now is the time. I'm really excited about the clients we're going to meet, the team we're going to build, and what we're going to achieve.
